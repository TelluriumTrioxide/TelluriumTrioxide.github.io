                            I decided to make an automatically generating navigation mesh system for my specialization because I wanted to get
                            more hands-on experience with complex editor-side systems, and really dig into the core of our AI and its pathfinding.
                            <br><br>In the future I would like to work with AI, so getting a good hang of automatic generation and
                            navigation meshes could help me get a more profound understanding of how pathfinding actors interact with the navmesh data. 
                            Furthermore, having more experience with the systems surrounding AI could help me lay a foundation for more complex automaton in the future as well.<br><br>

                            In this project I have had the opportunity to work with a lot of interesting algorithms, and even make a couple of my own!
                            Creating algorithms and seeing them work in practice has to be one of the most exciting feelings. I have a much better understanding
                            of how Delaunay (and by extension Voronoi) works, and have more experience with reading, interpreting and implementing
                            algorithms from scientific papers.<br><br>

                            I feel like the result has also shed light on how much I've evolved as a programmer during the course of the project. 
                            From expanding my knowledge on C/C++ syntax to being better at memory alignment and cache optimisation, I feel like I have gotten a much better hang of
                            the ins and outs of video game programming. <br><br>

                            One guideline that I set up for myself for this project was to try to minimize runtime heap allocations and keep as much data on the data segment. 
                            Partly to skip a bunch of costly allocations, but also to keep cache misses to a minimum.<br> With this in mind, I still needed to keep the code as stack friendly as possible.
                            This was a challenge since I had implemented a couple of algorithms as recursive, which is why I decided to rework them to be
                            iterative instead, as that method fit the narrative of the algorithms much better when having the stack in mind.<br><br>

                        <div class="description">
                            I looked toward <a href="https://github.com/recastnavigation/recastnavigation" target="_blank" class="link">Mikko Mononen's Recast</a> 
                            for inspiration and relevant data structures during this project, 
                            but I would have felt like this was a non-achievement if I just copied his methods.
                            Therefore I tried to only look at it heuristically and come up with my own methods
                            regarding actual implementation.<br><br>
                            
                            For the Mesh Voxelization, I put a 'walkable'-flag on the mesh component to be able to select which geometry
                            to rasterize. Then, iterated over their respecive AABBs to find where a voxel 
                            would intersect a triangle on the mesh, and add that voxel to the list. In order to not choke the CPU and eat all of the RAM, 
                            I had to make sure that it discarded triangles with an unwalkable slope and/or too small area before it tries to voxelize them.
                            So I added a pass where it first created a simplified mesh from the still relevant triangles, and iterated over those instead.<br><br>
                            
                            Somewhere around here I realized that iterating over three dimensions of voxels is simply not efficient enough,
                            and decided to condense it down to a 2D grid with vertical spans, 
                            which happened to make memory management a lot easier, and the cache let out a sigh of relief.

                            In order to tweak variables on the fly, to test the capability of the software, I needed a tool.
                            Luckily, I had created a manual Navmesh builder tool for the concurrent group project <a href="../Subpages/project7.html" class="link">Toys or Sus</a>,
                            and I could easily expand on it. Furthermore, I could conveniently access geometry in the scene through picking and tweak them in 
                            our entity inspector, both of which we had implemented some time before, so that our Level Designers 
                            could easily manipulate the world. This allowed me to easily construct 
                            best- and worst case scenarios, and a lot of edge cases, which is important when developing complex systems.<br><br>

                            Another invaluable tool for debugging and visualizing the progress were the debug lines, 
                            which allowed me to see progress all throughout the project. Hats off to our graphics programmer <a href="https://www.victorpetersson.com/" target="_blank" class="link">Victor Petersson</a> for
                            probably the most used feature in our engine (the rest of the rendering aside, haha). The coloured lines shown in the figures
                            are all such debug lines. The UI shown next to this block of text is the tool for the navmesh creation, with sliders for relevant
                            variables.

                        <div class="description">
                            From the long list of voxels spans now at my disposal, I had to start culling unnecessary and unappealing spans,
                            so that the resulting mesh would be as simple and pretty as possible. The first thing to go were technically
                            walkable areas, that were obstructed by another region above them where the distance between the two regions wasn't
                            high enough for the actor to fit under. Next, ledges had to go, and the condition was that if the top of a connected 
                            neighbour span was at too steep an angle from the top of the relevant span, the span is set to not walkable. This creates a nice curb
                            for the walkable area (see the middle picture).<br><br>

                            Next, I needed to come up with a way to create an outline for the mesh. I decided to create an algorithm that defines types for the spans,
                            marking them as CENTER, EDGE, SPECIAL EDGE, OUTER CORNER, INNER CORNER, or CATWALK. Then it iterates recursively over them, in
                            the counter-clockwise direction, going straight if it's an edge or special edge, turning left if it is an outer corner, and right if it is an inner corner.
                            If the algorithm encounters a CATWALK or CENTER it returns false, and the algorithm terminates once it completes a circuit, or exceeds the maximum number of nodes allowed.
                            If it encounters a SPECIAL EDGE, an OUTER CORNER, or an INNER CORNER, it adds that vertex to the outline. Since I was iterating over regions during this process anyway, 
                            I decided to mark the regions separately, so one could easily visualize them for debugging purposes (see the bottom picture).<br><br>

                            This algorithm works well for the purpose it's designed for, but it does not currently support holes in the mesh. 
                            I briefly considered adding support for that, but felt like it was a future improvement if anything, as I wanted to get the whole thing working first.

                        <div class="description" style="margin-left: auto;">
                            As shown in the pictures to the right (hover to expand), the purple outline generated by this method is very angular and not very organic,
                            so I wanted to try simplifying it to hopefully create fewer and more pretty triangles. To do this, I decided on using another recursive algorithm,
                            called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramer-Douglas-Peucker_algorithm" target="_blank" class="link">Ramer-Douglas-Peucker algorithm</a>, 
                            or line smoothing algorithm, to remove unnecessary vertices from the outline. Since the algorithm is designed to simplify 
                            a curve of line segments, I had to partition the outlines into smaller line segment curves, on which to apply the algorithm.
                            Incidentally, this made it very convenient to parallelize the process, which I on the other hand didn't do since 
                            this was not yet a very heavy operation, and I felt like optimization was a beast best saved for later, 
                            as premature optimization could kill a process if executed poorly.<br><br>

                            After battling for a while with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delaunay_triangulation" target="_blank" class="link">Delaunay</a> 
                            and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bowyer-Watson_algorithm" target="_blank" class="link">Bowyer-Watson</a>, I decided that what they provided was not
                            precisely what I needed at that moment for the triangulation. So I sat down on a Sunday, cup of tea in one hand, 
                            MS Paint in the other and started to design my own incremental algorithm for triangulation, which requires no additional
                            vertices, and does not need to compute the convex hull of a finite point set. While what I came up with is by no means perfect, I am
                            still very pleased with how it came out. 
                            <br><br>I call the algorithm "Two forward, two back".

                            The algorithm is not very complex, and pretty fussy with the input data.<br><br>
                            Given an ordered set of points (outline) of <i>m</i> elements, where <i>d</i> is the direction (-1 or 1);<br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Return early if there are fewer than 3 indices in outline.</li>
                                
                                <li>Repeat until there are 3 indices left in list, add them as a triangle to the output triangle list, and return:</li>
                                
                                <li>
                                    Starting from arbitrary index <i>i<sub>n</sub></i>, check if there can be a valid line drawn between values at 
                                    <i>i<sub>n</sub></i> and <i>i<sub>n+2d</sub></i>.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>If true, add { <i>i<sub>n</sub></i>, <i>i<sub>n+d</sub></i>, <i>i<sub>n+2d</sub></i> }
                                            as a triangle to the output triangle list and discard <i>i<sub>n+d</sub></i> from input. Then, <i>d = d * -1</i>.</li>
                                        <li>If false, <i>n</i> = <i>n+d</i>.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            Naïve as it is, it does the job, with some exceptions. I'm happy that I managed to create a generalized algorithm that works
                            as well as it does in the short time it took, and I think I could improve 
                            both the time (O(n<sup>2</sup>) worst case, I think) and make it more robust if I spent some more time on that.

                            All in all, I am very happy with how this project
                            turned out. I knew this was going to be a challenge, and I didn't know if I would even be able to finish
                            before the deadline, so having all the parts working together is a big relief.
                            Happy as I am, there are still some features I would like to add in the future.<br><br> 

                            One example is the outline generation algorithm, which is recursive when it really should have been incremental, partly
                            to make it more parallelizable, but also because it absolutely kills the stack memory trying to compute big navmeshes.<br><br>
                            I would like to pour some effort into improving the outline simplification as well, as it has the potential to make a really clean navmesh
                            if executed properly!
